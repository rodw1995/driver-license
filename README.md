A hobby **React + TypeScript** project to learn and try some new things:

- AWS Amplify
- AWS Auth/Cognito
- AWS AppSync
- GraphQL
- Apollo
- RamdaJS

Other included libraries:

- [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/)
- [React Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/guides/quick-start)
- [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/)
- [Notistack](https://iamhosseindhv.com/notistack)

## What is it?
A web app with authentication handled by AWS Cognito:

- Sign up with email confirmation
- Sign in
- Forgot password

Where you can keep notes of the driving lessons you've had. Always in sync with using AWS AppSync and GraphQL subscriptions.
